"""Hill-climbing verdicts and per-module goals over paired measurements.

An entity is either an application workload measured by
`benchmarks/bench.py` or a module kernel measured by `perf_modules.py`.
Each run yields, per metric, candidate/baseline ratios paired by round and a
bootstrap 95% interval for their median. (`bench.py`'s own `direction`
compares against a 3-sigma per-sample spread, which does not narrow with
more rounds, so a hill climb uses the interval of the paired median.) This
module turns runs into verdicts, one decision per attempt, and goal
statuses against the control. It performs no I/O.

A claim counts only when it replicates. Each run reads one of four outcomes
per metric: `improved` (its whole interval lies below 1 - allowance),
`regressed` (its whole interval lies above 1 + allowance), `within budget`
(its upper bound is at most 1 + allowance), or `inconclusive`. A metric takes
a replicated outcome only when every run supports it; runs that disagree, or
that cannot bound the ratio, leave it `inconclusive`. The allowance is
`PRACTICAL_FLOOR`. Ratios are candidate over baseline everywhere, so below 1
is faster or smaller.

Memory-only acceptance evaluates module load footprint and working peak,
and supported workload peak memory, with peak RSS required. Output equality,
complete memory evidence, and independent replication remain mandatory;
CPU, wall time, and host quietness cannot qualify or block acceptance.
