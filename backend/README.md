# RTLS and Graviola research

## Current implementation

The [native Linux arm64 candidate](LINUX_QUALIFICATION.md) is fully OpenSSL-free.
All 53 local archive checks and the isolated minimal-runtime check pass. The
full regression run executes 50,488 tests with no unexpected failures under
the declared modern policy. Follow the [Docker and prerelease procedure](LINUX_ARM64.md)
for the arm64-only workflow.

The [qualified macOS arm64 candidate](QUALIFICATION.md) is fully OpenSSL-free.
All 42 experimental archive checks pass, including the complete regression
report under the declared modern policy. The report retains raw upstream
failures, earlier unsuccessful runs, compatibility limits, artifact identity,
and measured sizes. Production adoption remains a separate decision.

The [modern TLS policy](MODERN_TLS_POLICY.md) defines the experimental support
matrix. Legacy TLS compatibility is no longer an adoption requirement. Keep
upstream results intact and distinguish retired capabilities from defects in
required modern behavior. Certificate security gates remain mandatory.

The isolated macOS arm64 candidate builds CPython 3.15.1 with compiled `_ssl`
and `_hashlib` explicitly disabled in `Modules/Setup.local`. OpenSSL is absent
from its native dependency graph. A separate fetch phase supplies checked,
locked Rust sources; the build runs with network access denied. The installed
`ssl` and `_hashlib` facades load their native adapters under `-I -S` after
relocation to a path containing spaces. Production remains unchanged.

The consolidated patch includes the repairs described below. Fresh preparation
matches all 101 RTLS and 118 rustls source files in the qualified snapshot.
The final candidate uses release Rust extensions, verified CPython PGO, and
ThinLTO. Stripping, pruning, archive extraction, relocation, and the declared
experimental qualification have completed.

`policy.rs` checks the actual webpki-verified leaf, intermediates, and original
trust anchor. It validates strict extension policy, issuer identifiers, anchor
constraints, and validity. Rejected paths can yield to another verified path.
Maintained webpki and Graviola implementations perform signature verification.
`TRUSTED_FIRST` controls issuer preference; only `PARTIAL_CHAIN` permits an
explicitly trusted intermediate to terminate the path. Invalid DER cannot
become a trust anchor, and root classification checks the self-signature.

The 82-case differential corpus matches pinned OpenSSL 3.5.7 acceptance under
the same flags, including the original missing-AKI and malformed-chain defects.
Twelve isolated verification-code gates also match, including missing AKI
(error 85) and missing CA SKI (error 86). A typed local webpki policy-error
enum preserves the cause through path building and the shared exception mapper;
its ranking remains identical to the previous generic extension error.
Duplicate critical extensions are rejected during candidate loading rather
than reference verification; the harness records this earlier rejection.
Certificate expiration includes the exact `notAfter` second. Canonical issuer
names govern issuer selection, cycle detection, self-issued path-length checks,
and CRL authority checks without changing signed bytes or keys.

Legacy RSA/SHA1 root self-signatures use x509-parser's maintained Ring-backed
verification API only during implicit-anchor classification. This restores valid
Mozilla roots without enabling SHA1 for certificate paths or TLS signatures.
The paired legacy-root test and all 82 security cases pass after this change.
A root with a corrupted self-signature remains rejected, although OpenSSL
accepts its explicitly trusted copy without checking that self-signature.
This deliberate restriction preserves the experiment's cryptographic
self-signed-anchor invariant and remains a documented compatibility difference.

Certificate and key ingestion validates complete PEM blocks and DER before
committing state. Eight paired PEM tests cover malformed footer suffixes,
allowed whitespace, surrounding text, and first-key selection. The public
`load_cert_chain()` accepts filesystem paths, matching CPython. Four paired
MemoryBIO tests cover contiguous buffers, byte counts, integer bounds, and EOF.

Offline CRL checking uses authoritative PEM CRLs loaded through `cafile` and
checks selected path certificates and anchors. Missing CRLs, revoked certificates,
invalid signatures, expiration, and future `thisUpdate` values fail verification.
`cadata` loads certificates only. Hashed-directory `.r0` CRLs, online fetching,
and delta or indirect CRLs are unsupported.

The 14-case trust-source contract passes with the real locked Mozilla bundle.
It covers explicit environment overrides, isolation flags, fallback suppression,
and hashed directories resolved at first use, including additions and removals
before lookup and retained certificates after caching. A malformed hashed file
is rejected atomically; OpenSSL can retain a valid prefix of that file.

SNI context selection preserves the initial connection's verification policy
and selects the callback context's certificates, trust sources, CRLs, cipher
and signature controls. Twelve SNI contract tests pass. Sessions, ALPN, keylog
clearing, socket I/O, and supported ECDH groups have focused upstream and
reference checks. Accepted listening sockets are wrapped with the TLS context.

`ssl_native_compat.py`, installed as `_ssl.py`, provides Python-level metadata
and certificate decoding for consumers such as CPython's own tests. It does
not restore CPython's compiled `_ssl` extension or its native object layouts.
It eagerly exports CPython 3.15.1's integer constants from `ssl_metadata.py`,
and `ssl_facade.py` builds the matching enum classes from those constants.
Backend versions and capability flags remain RTLS-specific. Kernel TLS is
unavailable: `OP_ENABLE_KTLS` is absent. The ordinary TLS `sendfile()`
fallback now transfers encrypted data through the ordinary TLS write path.
`ssl_metadata.py` also contains the CPython protocol-message enums.


The [hashing backend](hashing/README.md) passes complete `test_hashlib` and
`test_hmac` suites: 240 tests, 18 skips. Native extension, limited-API extension,
and shared-libpython embedding probes pass on the final extracted archive.

The v7d complete default-resource regression run executed 50,058 tests with
202 failures and 2,936 skips; 547 of 556 selected files ran, with nine
resource-denied files. Its six failing files are `test_asyncio`, `test_audit`,
`test_ftplib`, `test_ssl`, `test_support`, and `test_tools`. The makefile-folder
failures in `test_tools` match an existing product exclusion. The asyncio
subprocess test constructs an unquoted shell command from the relocated path.
The audit failure exercises unsupported finite-field DH parameters. The
remaining failures include actionable API and socket-lifecycle defects.
A preceding run had one additional process-pool failure; its isolated rerun
and the complete replay passed that file, without erasing the initial failure.

The earlier isolated development backend's complete `test_ssl` run executed 219 tests:
11 failures, six errors, and 39 skips. The remaining failures concern OpenSSL
identity/version guards, private C type behavior, retired DH/renegotiation,
OpenSSL option/entropy controls, and unsupported proxy-certificate flags.
That isolated run skipped an environment-sensitive key-log test and did not
expose intermittent wrong-role context failures. Both defects and the associated
descriptor leak are now fixed. The qualifying normal-startup full run records
219 SSL tests, 11 failures, six errors, and 38 skips, with no unexpected cases.
The raw upstream result remains a failure and is reported alongside the policy.

Both reset-socket regressions execute their full data/error assertions in the
direct contract. The generic audit-open regression also passes after the retired
DH entrypoint explicitly reports `NotImplementedError`, allowing the upstream
build-without-DH branch to exercise every other open-audit assertion.

The combined source passes the 82-case certificate corpus, 12 isolated strict
error-code gates, and 16 trust-source/ownership cases. Ten PEM-boundary cases
cover first-key selection and password callback ordering. The failed-load
identity guarantee is intentionally stronger than the reference context, which
can become unusable after a callback failure. Actual TLS message callbacks and
signature metadata pass their direct contracts. The upstream debug callback
class executes six tests with one additional skip. FTP, POP, HTTP server,
hashing, and HMAC suites execute 513 tests with 23 skips and no failures.
Three modern peer cases include forced X25519MLKEM768 interoperability with
the pinned OpenSSL reference. Six retired reference-negotiated features are
rejected without certificate failures or timeouts. Direct external HTTPS also succeeds using all 120 roots from the pinned Mozilla
bundle, through both a verified TLS 1.3 socket and `urllib` without proxy use.
The final archive repeats the certificate, modern transport, hashing, and
product qualification checks after stripping and extraction. The broader
ownership and interface contracts also pass on the release build.

Both adapters now have bindings that operate in separate interpreters. The TLS
binding uses a Rust-only handle registry and copied arguments through a narrow
C interface. Python callbacks run after native locks are released. Its contract
checks TLS 1.2 and 1.3 verification, repeated interpreter destruction, executor
workers, and cleanup after injected allocation and interruption failures.
Hashing uses per-interpreter CPython C API state. The preceding PyO3 import
restriction is repaired; final combined archive regression testing remains
outstanding.

A fresh OpenSSL-free PGO base has completed the locked 43-file profile task:
10,590 tests, 263 skips, and success, followed by its optimized ThinLTO rebuild.
Final modern overlay and extracted-archive qualification remain outstanding.

No macOS 26 runtime or Linux qualification is claimed. No clean build-time,
peak-memory, stripped-size, or compressed-artifact comparison is complete.
The current scope is macOS arm64, and performance gates are waived by the user.
The remainder records the earlier prototype and adoption requirements.

## Decision

Promoted: the OpenSSL-free backend is the official production
distribution. `build.yml` builds and qualifies all three targets with the
drivers in this directory and publishes the archives as official
prereleases. No OpenSSL source enters the build; Linux Rust extensions link
musl statically (`+crt-static`, `ld.lld`, no `kache` or `mold`); CPU floors
are Broadwell-class x86-64, ARMv8-A with crypto extensions, and Apple M1.
The pinned Rust toolchain is nightly-2026-09-15.

The sections below record the research history behind that decision.

The current OpenSSL recipe passes `no-apps no-tests` and retains its existing
`build_sw` and `install_sw` targets. The distribution uses the static
`libssl` and `libcrypto` libraries. It does not ship OpenSSL's command-line
applications or test programs. The native arm64 Alpine production dependency
build passed with LLVM 23.1.3 and installed both libraries without an OpenSSL
command. No before-and-after timing comparison was run, so this change has no
measured build-time claim. OpenSSL documents these configuration options in its
[3.5.7 installation guide](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/openssl-3.5.7/INSTALL.md).

## Why the prototype uses RTLS

The [`rust-cpython/overlay` experiment](https://github.com/joshuarli/python-build/tree/4752d8eda0cd3166bd042d994216b4f2a03137e9/rust-cpython/overlay)
demonstrates Rust-backed CPython object implementations, but its `_ssl_rs`
module delegates TLS operations to OpenSSL. Its `_hashlib_rs` and `_hmac_rs`
modules cover only part of CPython's hashing surface and retain RustCrypto
dependencies. That lane also targets a 3.16 development fork. It does not
provide a production-ready OpenSSL replacement for CPython 3.15.1.

[RTLS](https://github.com/jawah/rtls/tree/302423b49e494863d07630d50b15a9488ec85ef7)
provides a Python-level `ssl` adapter over rustls. The experiment pins its
2026.10.3 tag to commit `302423b49e494863d07630d50b15a9488ec85ef7` and replaces
the native AWS-LC provider with
[`rustls-graviola` 0.4.0](https://crates.io/crates/rustls-graviola/0.4.0),
which uses Graviola 0.4.1. The source pin, dependency changes, Rust adapter
changes, and lockfile update are in
[`rtls-graviola.patch`](rtls-graviola.patch).
The recorded licenses are in
[`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md). The patch removes the
RTLS AWS-LC native build crates and adds Graviola plus target support crates.
It does not measure Rust build time or extension size.

The provider exposes rustls cipher suites, key exchange groups, signature
operations, verification algorithms, and random bytes. It has no HPKE
provider. The patch therefore disables RTLS's ECH setup and returns an error
when a caller supplies ECH configuration. ECH support is an explicit gap.
The patch keeps the existing ring provider and ECH code behind WASI-specific
configuration; the Graviola dependency is limited to non-WASI targets. The
WASI target is not installed in the tested Rust toolchain, so this is source
inspection, not a WASI build result.

The Python `SSLContext` adapter subclasses CPython's standard-library context
when `_ssl` exists. The first prototype did not prove that `_ssl` could be
removed. The follow-up found and patched a concrete RTLS fallback defect: its
placeholder `_SSLSocket` was not a `socket.socket` subtype, although
`TLSSocket` calls `socket.socket.__new__`. The fallback now imports `_ssl`
first, avoids a partially initialized `ssl` import when `_ssl` is absent, and
uses a socket subtype. `run-no-ssl-contract.sh` verifies that behavior with a
disposable CPython 3.15.1 installation that has `_ssl` removed and `_hashlib`
retained.

## What the local prototype proves

On native Apple Silicon macOS 27, the patched adapter built with Rust nightly-2026-09-15 (`1.100.0-nightly`),
rustls 0.23.45, `rustls-graviola` 0.4.0, and Graviola 0.4.1. The earlier
Python 3.15.0 smoke completed verified TLS 1.3 loopback exchanges between a
Graviola client and both Graviola and OpenSSL servers.

The stronger follow-up used an isolated CPython 3.15.1 build linked to the
pinned OpenSSL 3.5.7. This probe build used Apple Clang 21 without PGO; it did
not use the production LLVM 23 toolchain or release recipe. After copying it
to a disposable prefix, removing only `_ssl`, retaining `_hashlib`, installing
the RTLS extension, and adding the research `ssl_facade.py` installed as
`ssl.py`, the candidate passed:

- isolated `import ssl`, `import hashlib`, and retained `hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac`;
- TLS 1.3 client/server exchange, `urllib.request.urlopen()` HTTPS, and
  `asyncio` TLS client/server operation;
- rejection of an untrusted issuer, the wrong hostname, and an expired leaf;
- the product-style test-bundle fallback, valid `SSL_CERT_FILE`, hashed
  `SSL_CERT_DIR`, suppression by empty and invalid explicit paths, and the
  bundle opt-out.

The same harness passed against the pinned OpenSSL 3.5.7 reference interpreter.
It is a focused contract probe, not a run of CPython's full `test_ssl` or
`test_asyncio.test_ssl` suites.
The RTLS candidate failed two certificate cases that OpenSSL rejected:
`VERIFY_X509_STRICT` accepted a leaf missing its Authority Key Identifier, and
`load_cert_chain()` accepted a malformed PEM certificate appended to a valid
chain. The harness exits nonzero for these cases. This is a meaningful API
feasibility result, but it fails the required certificate-policy gate.

The CPython 3.15.1 test used a local research facade and a test-only CA file
copied beside `ssl.py`; it did not use the production Mozilla bundle. Direct
RTLS `SSLContext.load_default_certs()` also fails in the candidate because
`wassima` is not installed. The facade supplies the product-style bundled
fallback for this experiment. No Linux target, production artifact,
performance result, or archive-size result was qualified. This Apple Silicon
host performed no amd64 verification.

## Compatibility gaps

RTLS is beta and its project prioritizes clients over servers. Its current
surface omits several CPython 3.15.1 interfaces, including signature-algorithm
and supported-group getters and setters. Session exposure and post-handshake
client authentication also differ from CPython's OpenSSL-backed module.

The candidate's `VERIFY_X509_STRICT` discrepancy is reproduced, not
hypothetical. CPython's 3.15.1 test certificate with a missing Authority Key
Identifier is rejected by OpenSSL 3.5.7 when strict verification is enabled;
RTLS accepts it even when the facade sets the strict flag. RTLS's
[verifier configuration](https://github.com/jawah/rtls/blob/302423b49e494863d07630d50b15a9488ec85ef7/rust/src/config.rs)
also maps `VERIFY_X509_TRUSTED_FIRST` and `VERIFY_X509_PARTIAL_CHAIN` to the
same trust-anchor behavior, although OpenSSL assigns them different meanings.
The malformed-chain case is independently reproduced: RTLS accepts an
invalid PEM item after a valid certificate and key, while OpenSSL rejects the
chain during `load_cert_chain()`.

RTLS's [context code](https://github.com/jawah/rtls/blob/302423b49e494863d07630d50b15a9488ec85ef7/src/rtls/_context.py)
loads operating-system roots through `wassima`; that module is absent from the
OpenSSL-free prefix. Its `set_default_verify_paths()` only handles
environment-specified paths, and `load_verify_locations(capath=...)` scans
filenames by extension instead of implementing OpenSSL hashed-directory
lookup. The research facade supplies the product's bundle fallback and
explicit-source precedence for the test. The harness verified file/hashed
directory inputs and empty/invalid override suppression under isolated Python
startup with both `-I` and `-E -s`, but it does not establish full OpenSSL
path-resolution parity.

The product's native-extension boundary also matters. A Python package can
use an alternate `ssl` module while a binary extension still imports
`libssl`, `libcrypto`, or `_ssl` internals. A Python-level adapter does not
provide those symbols or OpenSSL-owned object layouts.

## Separate hashing investigation

Do not combine a TLS prototype with a `hashlib` replacement. CPython already
ships built-in implementations for its guaranteed digest algorithms, so an
OpenSSL-free experiment can begin by inventorying which behavior needs a
replacement. The missing surface includes PBKDF2, scrypt, OpenSSL-named
constructors, and native `_hashlib` consumers. Preserve `hmac`,
`compare_digest`, `usedforsecurity`, digest copying, and documented
constructor and keyword behavior.

The isolated `rust-cpython/overlay` `_hashlib_rs` and `_hmac_rs`
implementations are useful examples of Rust-backed Python objects, but they
target a different CPython tree and use RustCrypto. They are not Graviola
integrations and are not dependencies of this prototype. Any hashing work
should be an independent patch with its own API inventory and CPython tests.
Keep OpenSSL's public C symbols available if native consumers remain part of
the product contract.

## Other replacement routes

The OpenSSL ABI compatibility route is not ready. The
[`rustls-openssl-compat` matrix](https://github.com/rustls/rustls-openssl-compat/blob/main/MATRIX.md)
marks `SSL_read_ex` and `SSL_write_ex` as unimplemented, marks
`SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites` as a stub, and leaves certificate and session
operations incomplete. It also retains OpenSSL `libcrypto`, so it cannot
remove OpenSSL from this distribution.

Replacing `_hashlib` alone also does not remove most OpenSSL build work.
CPython supplies guaranteed digest implementations in built-in modules, but
[`_hashopenssl.c`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.15.1/Modules/_hashopenssl.c)
provides PBKDF2, scrypt, OpenSSL named algorithms, and a native interface used
by extensions. A replacement must preserve [`hashlib.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.15.1/Lib/hashlib.py)
and `hmac` behavior without silently losing those functions.

## CPU and platform policy

Keep production baselines unchanged: `-march=x86-64`, `-march=armv8-a`, and
Apple M1. For future Graviola qualification, use separate candidate floors of
Broadwell-class x86-64 and ARMv8-A with crypto extensions; do not require the
candidate to run on legacy production floors that it would explicitly stop
supporting. These candidate floors do not change the production target
registry. Rust and C code must use the same declared CPU contract, and
qualification must run on hardware that satisfies it.

Graviola 0.4.1 declares Rust 1.89, Rust 2024 edition, and the license
expression `Apache-2.0 OR ISC OR MIT-0`. `rustls-graviola` 0.4.0 declares Rust
1.85. The upstream project has test-vector, fuzzing, and constant-time test
work; formally verified routines cover selected cryptographic code, not the
whole TLS stack or this Python adapter. This review did not establish an
independent audit of the complete project or an upstream musl qualification
for both product architectures.

The current prototype ran only on Apple Silicon macOS. It did not build the
Linux musl targets. Its Rust compilation used the Rust compiler's default
target CPU settings, not the product's C target flags. Before proposing Linux
support, qualify native
`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` builds using the
locked Alpine toolchains and the approved product CPU floors. Check static
linking, runtime assumptions, architecture requirements, and unexpected
dynamic dependencies.

Graviola's [compatibility table](https://github.com/ctz/graviola/blob/v/0.4.1/COMPATIBILITY.md)
lists Broadwell as its x86-64 floor. That is a candidate constraint for a
future build, not a reason to change the product baseline today.

The current macOS prototype ran on Apple Silicon and did not exercise the
candidate Linux floors. `-march=broadwell` and `-march=armv8-a+crypto` remain
candidate settings to validate with the actual C and Rust compilers. A compiler
flag alone does not prove that every binary stays within its declared CPU
floor. Do not change production settings until a separate product decision.

## Adoption gates

Keep production on OpenSSL until a candidate meets all of these conditions:

1. Preserve the CPython 3.15.1 `ssl`, `hashlib`, and `hmac` APIs that the
   distribution supports. Cover guaranteed digests, HMAC, `compare_digest`,
   PBKDF2, scrypt, copy behavior, and keyword semantics.
2. Pass the relevant CPython TLS suites for client and server operation,
   including TLS 1.2 and 1.3, ALPN, SNI, mutual TLS, certificate failures,
   hostname and IP checks, nonblocking I/O, `MemoryBIO`, orderly shutdown,
   and abrupt EOF. Resolve ECH, session resumption, and post-handshake
   authentication as explicit support decisions.
3. Match the product trust-source rules for normal and isolated startup.
   Test environment overrides, OpenSSL defaults, CA files, hashed directories,
   the bundled PEM, relocation, and the opt-out.
4. Build and run on all three candidate targets with the locked toolchains and
   candidate CPU floors: Broadwell-class x86-64, ARMv8-A with crypto
   extensions, and Apple M1. Inspect unresolved symbols, runtime dependencies,
   and native-extension behavior. Approve any production baseline change
   separately.
5. Record the trade-offs against the `no-apps no-tests` OpenSSL baseline when
   comparable measurements are available. The owner waived performance gates
   for this experiment. Current absolute artifact sizes are measured; clean
   baseline build-time, memory, and scratch comparisons remain unmeasured.

Record every unsupported API and intentional difference before changing the
product contract. Treat test-only success as research evidence, not release
qualification.

The certificate-policy gate controls production adoption. It does not stop
repairs in this isolated experiment. Production retains OpenSSL while the
candidate's certificate, trust-policy, hashing, and compatibility checks remain
incomplete. The current implementation scope is macOS arm64. Linux qualification
and performance gates are outside the current request.
